# hello-world

Hello to everyone who somehow found this!

My name is Jason Reuse and I am a beginner programmer! I am very excited to learn new things! My motivation for programming comes from a desire to create and develop websites! So far I have learned HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a bit of Javascript. My goal is to have a job in programming by the end of 2018! Wish me luck!
